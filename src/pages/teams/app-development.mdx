# App Development

The App Development team builds tools that abstract the complexity of our services away from the user. They focus on visual design, usability, and optimizing client side code. Internally, app devleopers create interfaces that expedite data collection and validation, in order to make repetitive tasks simple and quick.

## Contributions

- Design intuitive user interfaces.
- Translate design compositions into code.
- Build internal tooling that eases the challenges of scaling our projects.
- Architect client facing APIs that allow the wider developer community to effectively interact with our models.
- Present the final product of the club as a professional app.

## Getting Started

**TODO: Make this more in depth. This is placehodler text for now.**

CSAI currently uses web technologies to create their applications so that we can target all platforms simultaneously and reduce the amount of duplicate code across domains. The web stack sits atop Node, which is a library for running Javascript directly on the operating system. We won't be writing in node directly, but frameworks like React, Vue and Angular use it to create and launch projects.

1. Download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Choose any active projects from the list above.
3. Click on the Github icon.
4. Follow the directions on the page to get the project up and running.
