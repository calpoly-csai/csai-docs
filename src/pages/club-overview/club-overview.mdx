# Club Overview

The Cal Poly Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence club (CSAI) is a project oriented, mission based club that creates open source software to solve problems in the Cal Poly community. Club members vote on possible project avenues and work together throughout the year to narrow the problem space and impliment a solution. As projects progess, each developer will end up shifting throughout the software stack, picking up new skills along the way. Beyond the hands on projects, the CSAI community is a place for people to hang out, get feedback on personal projects and share ideas. We also provide members oppurtunites to grow, by bringing in guest lecturers and recruiters to talk about new oppurtunites and to educate everyone on new developments in the industry.
In short our mission is:

- To bring together inspired devleopers in a supportive and inclusive community
- To learn about state of the art algorithms and artificial intelligence models
- To directly apply what we learn by building impactful hardware and software
- To provide career and research opportunities to members

## What We Do

Our project meetings happen **every Sunday from 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM**. We start each meeting with some casual conversation and discuss the broader direction of the project. From here we define next steps and split off into teams to pair program. Since everything in the project is somehow connected, it is very common for developers to cross over between groups to help with integrations or seek answers to complex problems.

Guest lecturers speak at the club on an approximately monthly basis. We've had the opportunity to converse with the Amazon Alexa team, Project Jupyter and several smaller AI startups. This is a great opportunity to ask burning questions about the design strategies of these amazing projects and apply to job postings.
