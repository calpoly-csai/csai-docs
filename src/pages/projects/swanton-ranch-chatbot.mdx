# Swanton Ranch Chatbot

Swanton Pacific Ranch is an estate operated by Cal Poly where students go to learn about forestry, wildlife, agriculture and land management. The region attracts many tourists, who stop at Swanton to buy goods and walk around the farm. CSAI is creating a chatbot to answer visitorsâ€™ questions.

The model will be deployed around the ranch on Raspberry Pi microcomputers. Each Pi has a waterproof housing, microphone, speaker, and battery pack. Due to the rural location, the devices have to work without a cell or WiFi signal. The entire knowledge base is stored locally on each device along with the machine learning model. Visitors will have the opportunity to start conversations with the devices and learn about the ranch through stories.

An additional model deployed on a server will allow visitors to interact through a chatbot web interface and android app. Both interfaces allow the user to send text messages to the model and receive responses. The apps provide visitors with commonly asked questions to get them started.

This integrated chatbot ecosystem will provide visitors with a deeper understanding of regional history and the importance of the ranch.
