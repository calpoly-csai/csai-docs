# Swanton Ranch Chatbot

## Overview

Swanton Pacific Ranch is an estate operated by Cal Poly where students go to learn about forestry, wildlife, agriculture and land management. The region attracts many tourists, who stop at Swanton to buy goods and walk around the farm. CSAI is creating a chatbot to answer visitors’ questions.
The model will be deployed around the ranch on Raspberry Pi microcomputers. Each Pi has a waterproof housing, microphone, speaker, and battery pack. Due to the rural location, the devices have to work without a cell or WiFi signal, so all device resources are stored locally. Visitors will have the opportunity to start conversations with the devices and learn about the ranch through stories.

An additional model deployed to the cloud will allow visitors to interact through a chatbot web interface and an Android app. Both interfaces allow users to communicate with the Swanton Ranch Chatbot through text messages. The visual medium prompts new users with commonly asked questions to help them engage with the story of the ranch.

This integrated chatbot ecosystem will provide visitors with a deeper understanding of regional history and the importance of the ranch.

## Hardware

Swanton Pacific Ranch does not currently have an accessible WiFi signal in most regions, which means that the devices will not have access to a conventional cloud API. Therefore we need industry-grade, out-of-the-box ML solutions that can both operate offline and fit on an embedded system. The CPU of choice for the project is a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM. This can effectively run Rasa, the NLP solution for the chatbot, which demands at least 2 GB of RAM. We repurposed the Google Voice Kit for other hardware needs such as the speaker, microphone, and sound card, since Google provides the necessary drivers to interface these modules with the Raspberry Pi.

## API

The API is the routing infrastructure that allows our applications to interact with the chatbot machine learning model. We are using Rasa, which is a well-tested communications layer for chatbot applications. This allows the team to focus on the content of the application rather than the scaffolding. Through the API, users ask questions of our chatbot and developers can manipulate the knowledge graph to produce new stories. Since the deployment environment doesn’t allow our devices to connect to the internet, each device runs its own instance of the API server locally to query the model without reaching out to an external source.

## Chatbot Machine Learning Model

Our model is built on Rasa Core, which is an adaptable NLP framework. We are training Rasa to educate visitors about the history of Swanton Pacific Ranch. Our interaction model uses stories to keep a running dialogue with the user and lead them to new knowledge. These stories provides dialogue comparable to a tour guide.

Rasa Core uses its pre-trained model, conversation history, and training data to predict the user’s intent within the content of a conversation, not just the question at hand. This feedback loop within the context of a story allows the model to predict what the user will ask next. For example, if asked how Swanton got its name, the model will offer to elaborate on the meaning behind the name.

## Speech to Text

To convert audio to a textual form, our devices use Mozilla's free and open-source Deepspeech library. Mozilla crowd sourced the data for this system so the audio was collected and validated by volunteer contributors. The model is a state-of-the-art, offline solution using deep learning.

### Substring checking

Deepspeech has a tendency to incorrectly transcribe input audio streams. As such, this can cause problems when running the transcribed audio through Rasa. Since the domain of our project is specific, the number of Deepspeech inaccuracies can be handled accordingly. To handle this problem, we are analyzing common ways which Deepspeech inaccurately transcribes audio and using methods such as Fuzzy-matching to correct inaccurate substrings.

## Text to Speech

To answer questions, our device voice assistants respond with an audio recording. Since each device is deployed with a static knowledge base about Swanton, we reduce memory consumption and runtime computation by preprocessing all possible responses into audio files using Google’s text-to-speech engine. After determining the correct response, the voice assistant finds the corresponding recording and plays the audio to the user.

## Chatbot Messaging Interface

The graphical user interface for the Swanton Chatbot is a secondary mode of communication, used in situations where the voice user interface is not the ideal solution and for testing purposes. The software is a simple React web application that allows users to type messages to the chatbot. Users also have access to a curated list of suggested questions handpicked to broaden their knowledge of Swanton. Unlike the voice user interface deployed on our devices, the chat interface communicates with an instance of the Rasa API deployed in the cloud.
